## Getting Started

### Language
The project is written in Matlab and SystemVerilog. To enable arch-configurability, only the basic building blocks (processing element, data buffers and state machine) are written in pure SystemVerilog, and the middle and top architecture are specified by Matlab scripts.

### Prerequisites
* Vivado
* Matlab

```
Give examples
```

###Platform
* ZYNQ-7 ZC706 Evaluation Board
