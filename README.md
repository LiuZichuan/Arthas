# Arthas
An Arch-Configurable FPGA implementation of CNN Accelerator for Object Detection. 

![top_arch](https://github.com/LiuZichuan/Arthas/blob/master/fig/top.svg)

## Getting Started

## Language
The project is written in Matlab and SystemVerilog. To enable arch-configurability, only the basic building blocks (processing element, data buffers and state machine) are written in pure SystemVerilog, and the middle and top architecture are specified by Matlab scripts.

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.
